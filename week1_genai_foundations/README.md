# Week 1 – GenAI Foundations

## Overview
This week focused on building foundational knowledge of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Topics Covered
- What is Generative AI and how it differs from traditional AI
- Basics of Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Transformers, pretraining, and fine-tuning
- Prompt engineering fundamentals
- Responsible AI and LLM limitations

## Learning Resources
- Introduction to Generative AI (Google Cloud)
- Introduction to Large Language Models (Google Cloud)
- Prompt Engineering Guide (Google Cloud)

## Key Takeaways
- Generative AI creates new content, not just predictions
- LLMs are trained on massive datasets using transformer architecture
- Effective prompt engineering is critical for getting quality outputs
- Understanding challenges: cost, bias, and ethical use of AI systems
