# Insurance Risk Analysis using Vertex AI

## Overview
This project demonstrates how Vertex AI Studio can be used to prototype and deploy
a Generative AI application for insurance risk analysis.

The app analyzes unstructured insurance intake notes and generates:
- Risk summaries
- Key underwriting considerations
- Follow-up questions for insurers

## Tools & Technologies
- Google Vertex AI Studio
- Gemini (LLM)
- Prompt Engineering
- Cloud Run (serverless deployment)
- Gradio UI

## What I Built
- Designed a structured system prompt for insurance risk assessment
- Tested prompts using realistic insurance scenarios
- Deployed the prompt as a live web application
- Interacted with the deployed GenAI app through a chatbot interface

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Prompt-to-product workflow in Vertex AI Studio
- Deploying GenAI apps without backend code
- Understanding GenAI deployment considerations (auth, access control)
- Translating business problems into GenAI solutions

## Status
✅ Completed  
This project was built as part of the **Introduction to Vertex AI Studio** course.
