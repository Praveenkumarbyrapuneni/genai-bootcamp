## 🚀 Featured Project: Insurance Risk Analysis using Vertex AI

**Description**  
Built a Generative AI prototype using Google Vertex AI Studio and Gemini models
to analyze unstructured insurance notes and generate structured underwriting
risk summaries.

**What it does**
- Extracts key risk factors from unstructured text
- Identifies underwriting questions and red flags
- Produces structured, decision-ready summaries

**Tech Stack**
- Google Vertex AI Studio
- Gemini (multimodal GenAI)
- Prompt Engineering
- Cloud Run (prototype deployment)

**Status**
- ✅ Working prototype
- 🔜 RAG integration planned

# GenAI Bootcamp 

This repository documents my structured 6-week learning journey in **Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

## Overview
The goal of this bootcamp is to build strong foundations and hands-on experience in:
- Generative AI concepts
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- AI Agents
- Cloud-based GenAI deployment

## Progress Log

### Week 1 – GenAI Foundations

**Day 1**
- Completed Google Cloud course: *Introduction to Generative AI*
- Learned basics of generative models, LLMs, and GenAI use cases
- Earned Google Cloud completion badge

**Day 2**
- Completed Google Cloud course: *Introduction to Large Language Models*
- Learned about transformers, pretraining, fine-tuning, and LLM limitations
- Understood challenges such as cost, bias, and responsible use of LLMs
